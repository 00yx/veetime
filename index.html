            <h2>Forever and Always, Manjot</h2>
            <p>
                From the moment our worlds intertwined,<br>
                You captured my heart, my soul, my mind.<br>
                No words could ever express,<br>
                The love I feel for you, how much I’m blessed.<br><br>

                You are beauty in its truest form,<br>
                Not just in looks, but in the special warmth<br>
                Of your heart, your mind, your gentle brace,<br>
                The way love shines upon your face.<br><br>

                Your smile is brighter than the morning sun,<br>
                A light that can’t be outdone.<br>
                Your laughter’s a melody, soft and sweet,<br>
                A sound that makes my heart skip so many beats.<br><br>

                But it’s not just beauty my eyes can see,<br>
                It’s the way your soul speaks to me.<br>
                Your kindness, your strength, the way that you care,<br>
                You’re rare, you’re precious, beyond compare.<br><br>

                You’re not just someone I love,<br>
                You’re my peace, my stars above.<br>
                You’re my anchor, strong and true,<br>
                And there’s nothing in this world I wouldn’t do for you.<br><br>

                I vow to cherish, to love, to protect,<br>
                To never neglect, never ever forget<br>
                That you are worthy, more than you know,<br>
                And I’ll show you, through actions, not just words alone.<br><br>

                I won’t give you less than you deserve,<br>
                I’ll give you my all, my heart, my world.<br>
                Each day, I’ll strive to be the best I can be,<br>
                Not just for me, but for you, for we.<br><br>

                I’ll better myself, I’ll learn, I’ll grow,<br>
                So our love can flourish, strong and whole.<br>
                I’ll be patient, I’ll listen, I’ll stand by your side,<br>
                With loyalty and love that never subsides.<br><br>

                No distance, no hardship, no trial, no test,<br>
                Could make me love you any less.<br>
                I’ll never leave, I’ll never stray,<br>
                My heart is yours, now and always.<br><br>

                Through every storm, through every season,<br>
                I’ll be there, and you are the reason.<br><br>

                You are my everything, my heart, my home,<br>
                And with you, I am never alone.<br>
                So on this day, and all days too,<br>
                Know this, my love, I love you.<br>
